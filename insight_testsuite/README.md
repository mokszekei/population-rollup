Test 2 is designed based on test1: \
(a) I shuffled the order of rows, to test whether the code can catch every row of a Core Based Statistical Area when they are not grouped together \
(b) I added one mockup row with valid population data but invalid population percentage change data, to test whetehe the code can handle missing value in percentage change data. \
(c) I added another one mockup row with empty string in population 2000/2010 but valid population percentage change data, to test whether the code can handle missing value in population while calculating the average percentage change correctly.
